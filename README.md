<h3>Team Work Information</h3>
<p>We are using the issue approach. Meaning there will be an issue assigned to each member. History can be find in the issue tab within this repo. Below are the way we work together and contribute to this project:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repo using <code>git clone repo_https_link</code> (Only if this haven't done once before)</li>
  <li>Create a new branch in the local: <code>git branch branch_name_of_the_issue_linked</code></li>
  <li>Checkout that new branch and start the work: <code>git checkout branch_name_of_the_issue_linked</code></li>
  <li>After done making change: <code>git commit -m"the commit message"</code> make sure that to stage the file which related to the issue assigned <code>git add the_file_to_commit</code></li>
  <li>Push it back to the Repo: <code>git push</code> or <code>git push --set-upstream origin your_branch_name</code> for the first time to do the push.</li>
  <li>Pull request: In the github website, go to the repo and the branch, click create a pull request.</li>
